# Grit
Deliberately practicing coding to do better.

## Background
Angela Duckworth explains in her book <em>Grit</em> that the composition of grit (a perservering passion, of sorts) is:
1. interest (fun and play)
2. practice (time on the task)
3. purpose (deliberate practice), and
4. hope (eyes on the prize).

## Intention
This repo is a messy process, rather than a highlight reel. It may form into it's own application, or remain as an ever-changing checklist. The goal is to deliberately find my weaknesses and face them head-on. Remaining commfortable in my current "challenges" will not make me a better coder and designer.

## My Grit
1. Interest: Designing websites
2. Practice: Study and code 1-2 hours daily
3. Purpose: Code HTML and CSS, apply UI/UX/a11y principles, code backend and databases to better understand relationships of the full stack
4. Hope: ??? (dream big!)
