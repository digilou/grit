# Weaknesses
Focusing on my weaknesses (albeit painful) will allow me to strive to be better, rather than wasting time on praising my cleverness.

-[ ] Find code reviewers and pair programming buddies. Without this aspect of learning, I will fail when relying on my own perceptions of weaknesses.
-[ ] Document weaknesses (discomfort points, uncertainties) and tackle them in a logical, repetitive manner.
-[ ] Acknowledge when I don't fully understand a coding concept, so I can face the challenge rather than take an avoidance stance.
